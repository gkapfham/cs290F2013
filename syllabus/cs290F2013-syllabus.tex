\subsection*{Course Catalogue Description}

\begin{quote}
A study of the principles and concepts used in the specification, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance of
large software systems. Topics include requirements elicitation and analysis, formal specification, software
architectures, object-oriented design, software measurement, software testing and analysis, and evolution of a program.
Students practice the principles of software development by participating as group members in the creation of a
significant software application. One laboratory per week. Prerequisites: Computer Science 210 and 220 or permission of
the instructor. Offered in alternate years.

Along with reading the required books, you will be asked to study many
additional papers from a wide variety of both proceedings from

\subsection*{Grading Policy}

The grade that a student receives in this class will be based on the
following categories. All percentages are approximate and it is possible
for the assigned percentages to change during the academic semester if a
need to do so presents itself. 
%The course instructor will assign all
%grades, often in consultation with the module professors.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Class Participation&10\%\\
Research Notebook and Meeting Record&10\%\\
Writing and Practical Skill Assignments&15\%\\
Research Presentations&15\%\\
Module Proposals&30\%\\
Final Project&20\%
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Each of the above grading categories has the following definition:

\begin{itemize}
\item
{\em Class Participation:} All students are required to actively
participate during all of the class sessions. Your participation will
take forms such as answering questions about the required reading
assignments, asking the presenting student(s) a constructive question,
serving as a session chair for a group of presentations, and leading a
brainstorming session. You will receive a class participation grade
for each module of the course.

\item
{\em Research Notebook and Records:} All students must keep a research
notebook throughout the semester. Your notebook will contain your
observations about all of the reading assignments and details about your
own research interests. Each of the dated and signed notebook entries
should include paragraphs, diagrams, lists of important points and
relevant questions, links to Web sites, description of software
installation procedures, and other information about research in
computer science. Your research notebook will be collected and graded at
the end of each module. For each course module, students are asked to
attend a separate fifteen minute meeting with the course instructors.
% and
%the module professor. 
After your meeting with each of these individuals,
you must record the date, time, meeting subject, and receive the
signature of the professor. Your meeting record will be collected at the
end of the semester and a lack of signatures will serve to reduce your
score for this component.

\item
{\em Writing and Practical Skill Assignments:} For each of the
assigned research articles, a student will be responsible for
completing a paper review that contains short paragraphs that
summarize and evaluate the paper and then propose interesting thoughts
and areas for future work suggested by the reading. Moreover, for each
of the reading assignments from the OBAS and WFCS textbooks, you must
write a precis, or a ``concise summary of essential points,
statements, or facts'' about the assignment (Merriam-Webster Online
Dictionary). During each module of the course, students also must
complete a wide variety of practical skill assignments (e.g., writing
papers in \LaTeX, using the ACM Digital Library, installing open source
software, creating technical diagrams with Graphviz and PGF/Ti\emph{k}Z, and
formatting algorithms and equations in \LaTeX).
%The paper reviews, the precis documents, and the practical skill
%assignments will be graded by the course instructors.

\item
{\bf Research Presentations:} During each module of the course, a
student (or a group of students) will give a forty to fifty minute
presentation explaining the assigned article and suggesting areas for
future research. On the last day of each module, every student will
give a lightning talk, or a short presentation that leverages no more
than two slides to describe the topic that you currently intend to
pursue for your senior thesis research.
%The module professor and the course
%instructor will collaboratively assign a grade to your presentations in
%a module.

\item
{\bf Module Proposals:} Using \LaTeX, \BibTeX, and other relevant
tools, a student is responsible for writing a five page proposal that
connects to the theme(s) of each module. Your proposal should contain
an interesting and informative title, a one paragraph abstract, and
several sections of text that describe your proposed
research. Students are strongly encouraged to meet with the course
instructors and the module professor about their proposed
research. The proposal for module $i$ will be due one week after the
start of module $i+1$.
%The module professor and
%the course instructor will collaboratively assign a grade to each of
%your module proposals.

\item
{\bf Final Project:} Each student must complete a final project that
consists of a ten page research proposal, a poster suitable for
presentation during a department-wide poster session, and a fifteen to
twenty minute presentation detailing your proposed research to the
class. 
%All professors in the Department of Computer Science will be
%invited to attend your research presentations and assist in the
%assignment of the grade for this part of your final project. 
%The course
%instructor and the professor whose areas of expertise are most related
%to your proposed research will evaluate your proposal and assign a
%grade. 
While the course instructors will give you a grade for your poster
and your participation in the poster session, all students and faculty
in the Department of Computer Science will be invited to provide you
with written feedback about your proposed work and the poster itself. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Assignment Submission Policy}

All assignments will have a given due date. The printed version of the
assignment is to be turned in at the beginning of the class on that due
date. Late assignments will be accepted for up to one week past the
assigned due date with a 10\% penalty. All late assignments must be
submitted at the beginning of the class that is scheduled one week after
the given due date. Unless special arrangements are made with the course
instructor, no assignments will be accepted after the late deadline.

\subsection*{Class Attendance Policy}

It is mandatory for all students to attend class. If you will not be
able to attend a class session, then please see the course instructors at
least one week in advance in order to describe your situation. Students
who miss more than five unexcused classes will have their final grade in
the course reduced by one letter grade. Students who miss more than ten
unexcused classes will automatically fail the course.

\subsection*{Laboratory Attendance Policy}

In order to acquired the proper skills in technical writing, critical
reading, and the presentation of technical material, it is essential
for students to have hands-on experience in a laboratory. Therefore,
it is mandatory for all students to attend the laboratory sessions. If
you will not be able to attend a laboratory, then please see the
course instructors at least one week in advance in order to explain
your situation. Students who miss more than two unexcused laboratories
will have their final grade in the course reduced by one letter grade.
Students who miss more than four unexcused laboratories will
automatically fail the course.
