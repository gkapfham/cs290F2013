<h3>Course Meeting Schedule</h3>

<p>
<i>Lecture and Discussion</i>: Tuesday and Thursday 11:00 - 12:15,
Alden Hall 101
</p>

<p>
<i>Laboratory Session</i>: Monday 2:30 - 4:20, Alden Hall 109

</p>

<h3>Course Objectives</h3>

<p>
The process of developing software involves the application of a
number of interesting theories, tools, techniques, and methodologies.
In this class we will explore the phases of the major software
development life-cycles and examine the important concepts, tools, and
open research questions that fit into each phase.  Throughout the
semester, we will examine the interplay between the theory and
practice of software development.  We will delve into the details of
software specification, design, implementation, testing, and
maintenance through a discussion of articles and book chapters from
the software engineering and software testing literature.  Moreover,
students will enhance their ability to write about software in a clear
and concise fashion.  Finally, students will gain practical software
development experience in laboratory sessions and a final software
development project.
</p>

<h3>Performance Objectives</h3>

<p>
At the completion of this class, a student should be aware of the
challenges and complexities of software development.  Furthermore, a
student should be comfortable with a wide array of tools, techniques,
concepts, and methodologies that can be applied to the problem of
developing large software systems.  However, a successful student of
this class will emerge with more than an understanding of the tools
(e.g., text editors, compilers, debuggers, integrated development
environments, modeling tools, and version control systems) that a
software engineer uses.  A student should have a fundamental
understanding of the major software life-cycles and the activities
that take place in each phase of these cycles.  Finally, a student
should develop a basic understanding of some of the current research
and the open research questions in fields such as software
engineering, software testing, program analysis, and software
maintenance.  After completing this class, a student should be
equipped for further graduate study in the fields of computer science
and software engineering.  The student should also be able to more
effectively participate in real-world software development projects.
</p>

<h3>Reading Information</h3>

<p>
The primary text for this course is <em>Software Engineering: Theory
and Practice</em>, by Shari Lawrence Pfleeger and Joanne M. Atlee.
This book provides a balanced introduction to all phases of the
software life-cycle.  The secondary text for this course is <em>The
Mythical Man Month</em> by Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.  This book
contains many thought-provoking essays about the field of software
engineering.  Students are responsible for carefully reading all of
the assignments from these two main text books.  In some cases,
students will have homework assignments that require them to present
and lead discussions about the readings from these two books.
</p>

<p>
The required text will be supplemented with articles from a number of
different sources.  Additional articles from important computer
science and software engineering magazines and journals, such as
<i>Communications of the ACM</i>, <i>IEEE Software</i>, <i>IEEE
Computer</i>, <i>IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</i>, and
<em>ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</em>
could be examined to further expand and deepen the scope of the
required material.  Technical reports that have been published in the
<a href = "http://portal.acm.org">ACM Digital Library</a> or
the <a href = "http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/">CiteSeer Repository</a>
could also be used as additional texts.  Finally, selected chapters
from additional texts could be examined during the semester.
Candidate books might include, but are not limited to, the following
titles.

<h3>Assignment Submission Policy</h3>

<p>
All assignments will have a given due date.  The printed version of
the assignment is to be turned in at the beginning of the class on
that due date.  Late assignments will be accepted for up to one week
past the assigned due date with a 10% penalty.  All late assignments
must be submitted at the beginning of the class that is scheduled one
week after the given due date.  In a course that requires group
project work, like Computer Science 290, students should be aware of
the fact that late work can negatively impact the progress of a group
project.
</p>

<h3>Class Attendance Policy</h3>

<p>
It is <strong>mandatory</strong> for all students to attend class.  If
you will not be able to attend a class session, then please see the
Instructor at least one week in advance to describe your situation.
Students who miss more than five unexcused classes will have their
final grade in the course reduced by one letter grade.  Students who
miss more than ten unexcused classes will automatically fail the
course.  Students should also bring their textbook and all of the
current reading assignments to each of the class sessions.
</p>

<h3>Laboratory Attendance Policy</h3>

<p>
In order to explore the discipline of computer science, it is
essential for students to have hands-on experience in a laboratory.
Therefore, it is <strong>mandatory</strong> for all students to attend
laboratory sessions. If you will not be able to attend a laboratory,
please see the Instructor at least one week in advance to explain your
situation.  Students who miss more than two unexcused laboratories
will have their final grade in the course reduced by one letter grade.
Students who miss more than four unexcused laboratories will
automatically fail the course.
</p>

<!-- 

<h3>Question of the Day</h3>

<p>
Before the beginning of each class (except for the first class of the 
semester), a random number will be generated.  This random number will be used
to select a student from the class.  This student will be responsible for 
answering a detailed and difficult question about the material that has been
covered in the past two or three classes.  Each student response will be 
graded on the scale of <em>pass</em> or <em>fail</em>.  Since the numbers will
be chosen randomly, there is no limit to the number of time(s) or the number
of sequential time(s) that a student could be selected.  The final 
"question of the day" grade for each student will simply be the average of
all of the student's scores (i.e. 1 for <em>pass</em> and 0 for 
<em>fail</em>).
</p>

<p>
While it is possible for a student to never be selected throughout the
entire semester, this has not happened in past semesters.  The
Instructor reserves the right to pose a "question of the day" to a
student that has not been asked a question if a limited amount of the
semester remains.  Each student is able to earn one <em>pass</em> for
a question of the day.  This pass can be applied <em>after</em> the
student has heard the question.  However, a pass can only be earned
after a student posts a review of a "serious" (or, potentially
"semi-serious") work of literature on the course Website.  Students
who post reviews of "grocery store books" or computer science
textbooks are not eligible for a pass.
</p>

-->

<!-- 

<h3>Homework Assignments</h3>

<p>
All homework assignments will involve the reading of the sections in
the textbook.  All students are responsible for reading all of the
assignments.  However, the Instructor will select a student for each
homework assignment.  This student will be responsible for responding
to the questions that have been posted about a specific reading
assignment.  Students will normally have between three and five days
to post their responses to the homework questions.
<b>Students must submit a printed copy of their homework in class on
the day that it is due</b>.  
</p>

<p>
During class discussions, the selected student will be viewed as the
expert on the assigned readings.  The homework grade for a specific
student will be the average grade that the student received on all of
their homework assignments.  The due date for the assignment will be
listed next to the assignment itself and also corresponds to the
tentative date on which we will discuss the material in class.
<b><em>Remember, all students are responsible for reading all of the
homework assignments</em></b>.  The Instructor will use questions from
the homework assignments as the foundation for the questions that will
appear on the examination.
</p>

-->

<h3>Laboratory Assignments</h3>

<p><p> Laboratory assignments will require students to explore the
concepts, tools, and techniques that are associated with different
phases of the software development lifecycle.  All laboratory
assignments will require the use of the provided tools to design,
implement, test, and maintain programs that solve important problems.
Each laboratory assignment will normally be provided on the day before
our scheduled laboratory session.  The Instructor expects students to
read the laboratory assignment before attending the session to prepare
themselves appropriately.  Unless specified otherwise, each laboratory
assignment will be due at the beginning of the next laboratory
session.  Many of the laboratory assignments in this course will
require the students to give a presentation and a demonstration of the
software that they implemented and tested.
</p>

</p>

<h3>Final Project</h3>

<p>
This class will present you with the description of a problem and
require you to implement solutions using one or more programming
languages and a wide variety of other software development tools.  The
final project in this class will require you to utilize all of the
knowledge that you have accumulated during the course of the semester
in order to solve a problem and, whenever possible, make your solution
publicly available as a free and open source tool.  The project will
require you to draw upon your problem solving skills and your
knowledge of programming languages and software engineering tools.
Furthermore, the final project may involve a significant experiment to
discover, understand, and/or evaluate one or more algorithms or
software applications.  Finally, we will aim to publish a research
paper describing the implementation, empirical evaluation, and use of
the system that you implement for the final project.
</p> 

<h3>Use Policy for Laboratory Facilities</h3>

<p>
Throughout the semester, we will experiment with many different
software tools that computer scientists use throughout the software
development life-cycle.  The Instructor and the Department's Systems
Administrator have invested a considerable amount of time to ensure
that our laboratories support the completion of laboratory assignments
and the final project.  To this end,
<b><em>students will be required to complete all assignments and the
final project while using the Department's laboratory
facilities</em></b>. The Instructor and the Systems Administrator will
only be able to devote a limited amount of time to the configuration
of a student's personal computer.
</p>

<h3>Preparation for Class Sessions</h3>

<p>
The study of the computer science discipline is very challenging.
Students in this class will be challenged to learn the principles and
practice of software development.  During the coming semester even the
most diligent student will experience times of frustration when they
are attempting to understand a challenging concept or complete a
difficult laboratory assignment.  In many situations some of the
material that we examine will initially be confusing : do not despair!
Press on and persevere!
</p>

<p>
In order to minimize confusion, students must invest time to prepare
for class discussions and lectures.  During our class periods, the
Instructor will often pose demanding questions that could require
group consultation, the creation of a program, or a vote on a
thought-provoking issue.  Only students who have prepared for class by
reading the assigned material and reviewing the laboratory and reading
assignments will be able to effectively participate in these
discussions.  More importantly, only prepared students will be able to
extract the knowledge that is needed to be successful in this course.
Important portions of the material that will be discussed during the
semester will not be in the textbook.
</p>

<p>
In order to help students to remain organized and effectively prepare
for classes, the Instructor will maintain a class schedule with
reading assignments and additional Instructor notes.  The reading
assignments will be directly integrated into the class schedule.
Throughout the class sessions students will also be required to
download, use, and modify programs, diagrams, and data sets.  All of
these materials will be provided on the course Web site.  Students who
are not comfortable with compiling, editing, and using simple Java
programs should see the Instructor immediately.
</p>

<p>  
Remember this motto, <em>semper paratus</em>!
</p>

<h3>Submitted Source Code Policy</h3>

<p>
No source code will be accepted unless the code is printed with the
command <code>enscript -2rG</code>, the command <code>a2ps
--pretty-print=Java</code>, the printing features in a text editor
such as emacs, or another equivalent command.  This means that your
code <em>must</em> have the date clearly printed at the top of the
page.  (If the
<code>enscript</code> or <code>a2ps</code> programs are not correctly
printing your files, then please see the course Instructor).  All
source code that is not submitted in this fashion will be <em>assigned
a total of zero points</em>.  That is, the student will earn an "F" on
this laboratory or portion of the final project. The first time that a
student violates this requirement, he/she will be given a resubmit
option.  After this single resubmit option has been exercised, a
student will be awarded an "F" for all further infractions.
</p>

<h3>Disability Services</h3>

<p>
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal
anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights
protection for persons with disabilities.  Among other things, this
legislation requires all students with disabilities be guaranteed a
learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of
their disabilities.  Students with disabilities who believe they may
need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Disability
Services at +1 814-332-2898.  Disability Services is part of the
Learning Commons and is located in Pelletier Library.  Please do this
as soon as possible to ensure that approved accommodations are
implemented in a timely fashion.
</p>

<h3>Honor Code</h3>

<p>
The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at
Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny Course Catalog.  The
Honor Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic
credit or to meet non-credit requirements for graduation at Allegheny
College.  This includes all work done in class (such as examinations,
quizzes, and laboratory work), all papers, and any other material that
might be assigned in this class.
<i>All students who have enrolled in the College will work under the
Honor Program</i>.  Each student who has matriculated at Allegheny
College has acknowledged the following pledge:
</p>

<p>
<i>
I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as
defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both
myself and the College community as a whole.
</i>
</p>

<!-- 

A student that is responsible for responding to a specific homework
assignment must acknowledge any formative conversations that they
conducted with other members of the class.

-->

<p>
In this course, students are encouraged to conduct <i>high-level</i>
discussions with their fellow classmates about the laboratory
assignments.  For group projects, the Instructor considers it a
violation of the honor code for students to share source code segments
with other students who are not a member of their group.  For
individual assignments, the Instructor considers it a violation of the
honor code for students to share source code segments with any other
students in the class.  If a student is experiencing difficulties with
the low-level details of a laboratory, they are encouraged to seek
help from the Instructor.  The Instructor reserves the right to use
several different automated tools that scan source code to check for
plagiarism violations.  Furthermore, the Instructor reserves the right
to use different automated tools to scan written responses to
assignments for plagiarism violations.
