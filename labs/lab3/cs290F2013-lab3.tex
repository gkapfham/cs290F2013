\MYTITLE{Laboratory Assignment Three: Using Vim to Implement and Test Java Programs}
\MYHEADERS{Laboratory Assignment Three}{Due: September 25, 2013}

\section*{Introduction}

Practicing software engineers normally use an integrated development environment (IDE) to manage various tasks
associated with the design, implementation, and testing of software. In this course, we will use Vim as an IDE.  In this
laboratory assignment, you will work with your team members to learn about the basic features associated with Vim and
prepare a tutorial that explains how to use Vim runtime configuration files and plugins to manage tasks in the software
development life cycle.  Students should program the HTML-based tutorial slides using Vim.
