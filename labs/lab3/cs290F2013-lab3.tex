\MYTITLE{Laboratory Assignment Three: Using Vim to Implement and Test Java Programs}
\MYHEADERS{Laboratory Assignment Three}{Due: September 25, 2013}

\section*{Introduction}

While it is possible to implement and test Java program in Vim without the use of any additional plugins, it is often
useful to extend Vim with a plugin called Eclim.  As described at \url{http://eclim.org/}, Eclim is a plugin that makes
it possible to access the features of Eclipse through Vim.  This means that you can program in Vim and use Eclipse
features such as code completion, searching, validation, and compilation. In this laboratory assignment, you will work
with your team members to learn how to use the basic features associated with Eclim.  Then, leveraging your knowledge of
Git, Vim, and Eclim, you will implement a test suite and user interface for a small Java program.  Finally, you will 
give a demonstration of your working test suite and program.

\section*{Learning the Basics of Eclim}

Eclim provides a convenient and easy-to-use interface to all of the features provided by Eclipse.  Since we will be
using Eclim's Java-based features in Vim, you should study \url{http://eclim.org/vim/java/index.html} to learn how to
use this plugin.  In particular, make sure you can use:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\tt :PingEclim}
	\item {\tt :ProjectCreate}
	\item {\tt :ProjectList}
	\item {\tt :ProjectInfo}
	\item {\tt :JavaDocComment}
	\item {\tt :JavaFormat}
	\item Code completion with CTRL-x, CTRL-u 
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Implementing and Testing a Java Program}

Once you have finished learning the basics of Eclim, you are ready to access a Bitbucket-hosted Git repository that
contains the source code for the system that you will finish implementing and testing.  First, the members of each team
should ask the instructor to share the Bitbucket repository with them. Once the repository is in your Bitbucket
dashboard, you should use a terminal to execute this command in an appropriate directory: {\tt git clone
git@bitbucket.org:gkapfham/kinetic.git}.

Once you have finishing cloning the repository, please take some time to study the directory structure.  What files do
you find? What important aspects of the directory structure do you notice?  At this point, you should examine the
.eclimrc\_k file that is responsible for configuring Eclim to find Kinetic project that is this assignment's focus.
Please use Vim to change the {\tt sgi.instance.area.default} variable so that it points to directory containing the Git repository. 

Now, you are ready to run the Eclim daemon called {\tt eclimd}.  Using the {\tt which} command in your terminal, find
out where this command was previously installed on your workstation.  Once you have verified that {\tt eclimd} is
installed on your machine, run {\tt eclimd} with the {\tt -f} flag to specify that the .eclimrc\_k file should be used
as the runtime configuration file for Eclim.  After running this program, what output do you see in the terminal window?

If {\tt eclimd} is running correctly, then you can type {\tt gvim} in a terminal window from the {\tt kinetic}
directory. Using CTRL-P, load the build.xml file and study the rules that it provides.  Next, use CTRL-P to load the
Kinetic.java, KineticTest.java, and AllTests.java files.  Again, please carefully review these Java classes to make sure
that you understand the provided methods. Once you understand both the build file and the Java classes, you should 
use the {\tt :PingEclim} command to make sure that GVim can connect to the Eclim daemon.  If you see debugging output
showing the current version of both Eclim and Eclipse, then you can issue the {\tt :ProjectCreate} command in GVim to
create an Eclipse project for Kinetic.  Once the project was successfully created, you can run {\tt :ProjectList}
and {\tt :ProjectLInfo} to ensure that you properly configured Eclim. 
 
Since Vim is already configured to operate as an integrated development environment, it contains features that support
the compilation and testing of your Java source code.  For instance, we can use the Apache Ant build system, described
at \url{http://ant.apache.org/} to perform automated compilation and testing of our program. If you type {\tt :Ant
	compile} you can run the Java compiler for the three Java classes that are part of the project.  Next, run the {\tt
	:Ant test} to run the test suite.  Finally, do not forget to run the {\tt :Ant clean} command. What output do you
	see when you run these commands? Please see the instructor if these commands do not work correctly.

\section*{Summary of the Required Deliverables}

This assignment invites your team to submit one printed version of the following files:

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item A description of the input(s), output(s), and behavior of the basic Eclim commands 
	\item A description of the output(s) and behavior of Vim's implementation and testing commands
	\item 

\end{enumerate}

You must also ensure that the instructor has read access to your Bitbucket repository that is named according to the
convention {\tt cs290F2013-lab3-team{\em k}}, with {\tt {\em k}} representing the number of your assigned team. 
Each team should submit both the source code.
