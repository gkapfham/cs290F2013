\MYTITLE{Laboratory Assignment Seven: Using Mutation Analysis to Evaluate Test Suites}
\MYHEADERS{Laboratory Assignment Seven}{Due: November 13, 2013}

\section*{Introduction}

In the previous laboratory assignments, you learned about the tools that we will use to specify, design, implement,
test, and document Java programs.  You also had several experiences with working in progressively larger teams to
complete the phases of the software life cycle, with a recent focus on the elicitation of software requirements, the
planning of software projects, and the analysis of a project's design and implementation.  In this assignment, you will
install and use a mutation analysis tool that will help you to determine the quality of a test suite.  During the final
project, you can use this tool to better gauge how effectively you are testing your code. A week from now, you will
demonstrate to the instructor that you are able to perform mutation analysis.

You must also ensure that the instructor has read access to your Bitbucket repository that is named according to the
convention {\tt cs290F2013-lab7-team{\em k}}, with {\tt {\em k}} representing the number of your assigned team.  Your
repository should contain all of the deliverables that you produced during the completion of this assignment.  Please
see the instructor if you have any questions.
