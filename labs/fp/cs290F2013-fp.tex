\MYTITLE{Final Project Assignment: Implementing and Releasing a Twitter Analytics System}
\MYHEADERS{Final Project Assignment}{Due: December 13, 2013 at 5 pm}

\section*{Introduction} 

Throughout this semester, you learned how to use tools that enable you to to specify, design, implement, test, and
document Java programs.  You also had several experiences with working in progressively larger teams to complete the
phases of the software life cycle, with a focus on the elicitation of software requirements, the planning of software
projects, and the analysis of a project's design, implementation, and test suite.  In this final project assignment you
will follow the phases of the software development lifecycle to create and release Twitter analytics software.

\section*{Using Twitter}

Twitter is a microblogging service that allows you to send and receive short, 140-character messages.  While many
Twitter clients allow you to send and receive tweets and search for trending topics, few give you the ability to search
and analyze all of the Tweets that you have sent over the entire time you have used Twitter. If you have tweeted many
times in the past, it is particularly difficult to implement a Twitter client that downloads your entire history of
tweets because of the way in which Twitter rate limits its application programming interface.  Since many people are
interested in search through all of their tweets, Twitter recently announced a mechanism for downloading them all to
your computer, as described at the following Web site \url{https://blog.twitter.com/2012/your-twitter-archive/}.
However, manually searching through this archive is very cumbersome.
