\MYTITLE{Laboratory Assignment Four: Team-Based Implementation and Testing of a Program}
\MYHEADERS{Laboratory Assignment Four}{Due: October 9, 2013}

\section*{Introduction}

In the previous laboratory assignments, you have been learning about the tools that we will use this semester to
specify, design, implement, test, and document Java programs. Moreover, our past class session have introduced you to
the key concepts associated with software engineering.  In this assignment, you and your team will follow the phases of
the software development life cycle and employ the concepts that we have studied in class  to implement and test a
program. Two weeks from now, you will present your solution and demonstrate your test suite and program.

\section*{Specifying the Requirements}

You are responsible for implementing a data generator that should take a list of numbers as input and produce a list of
lists as output.  You are given the following specification for the data generator.

\begin{quote}
For an input list of numbers $L$, the data generator must produce all of the lists that can be obtained by swapping two
adjacent items in $L$.
\end{quote} 	

\noindent
For the list $L = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, the customer thinks that the generator should produce $L=\{L_1, \ldots, L_6\}$ 

\begin{itemize}
	\item[] $L_1 = \{2, 1, 3, 4\}$
	\item[] $L_2 = \{3, 2, 1, 4\}$
	\item[] $L_3 = \{4, 2, 3, 1\}$
	\item[] $L_3 = \{1, 3, 2, 4\}$
	\item[] $L_4 = \{1, 4, 3, 2\}$
	\item[] $L_6 = \{1, 2, 4, 3\}$
\end{itemize} 

The customer knows that the component that you must implement will be a part of a larger system that has not yet been
fully implemented.  You are responsible for implementing this data generator so that it functions according to the
provided specification.  However, please note that the provided requirements may not be entirely correct!  It is the job
of your team to interact with the customer to ensure that the system is implemented as desired.  Using \LaTeX, you
should write a requirements document that fully explains the inputs, outputs, and behavior of the data generator.

\section*{Summary of the Required Deliverables}

This assignment invites your team to submit one printed version of the following files:

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item A description of and justification for your team's chosen organization, roles, and tool support
	\item A requirements document that clearly specifies the inputs, outputs, and behavior of the data generator

\end{enumerate}

You must also ensure that the instructor has read access to your Bitbucket repository that is named according to the
convention {\tt cs290F2013-lab4-team{\em k}}, with {\tt {\em k}} representing the number of your assigned team.  Your
repository should contain all of the deliverables that you produced during the completion of this assignment.  Please
see the instructor if you have any questions.
