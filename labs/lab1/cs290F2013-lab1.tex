\MYTITLE{Laboratory Assignment One: Version Control with Git and Bitbucket}
\MYHEADERS{Laboratory Assignment One}{}

\section*{Introduction}

Practicing software engineers normally use a version control system to manage most of the artifacts produced during the
phases of the software development life cycle.  In this course, we will always use the Git distributed version control
system to manage the files associated with our laboratory assignments.  In this laboratory assignment, you will learn
how to use the Bitbucket service for managing Git repositories and the {\tt git} command-line tool in the Ubuntu Linux
operating system.
