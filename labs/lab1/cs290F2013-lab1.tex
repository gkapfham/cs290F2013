\MYTITLE{Laboratory Assignment One: Version Control with Git and Bitbucket}
\MYHEADERS{Laboratory Assignment One}{}

\section*{Introduction}

Practicing software engineers normally use a version control system to manage most, if not all, of the phases associated
with developing software.  In this course, we will always use the Git distributed version control system to manage the
files associated with our laboratory assignments.  In this laboratory assignment, you will learn how to use the
Bitbucket service for managing Git repositories and the {\tt git} command-line tool in the Ubuntu Linux operating system.
